                        <p id="area-p">The local area is made up primarily of suburban housing estates, there is often a lot of hustle and bustle between joggers, dog walkers , shoppers buying groceries or people out and bout for their 10,000 steps. Because of this, Parklife Café has become a familiar favourite of locals. We chose the location of the Café deliberately so that it would be a perfect spot for Crumlin residents to meet and catch up, without having to travel too far.</p>

                        <p id="dog-p">We pride ourselves on being dog friendly. On a typical day in the café you can see jackrussels, pugs, labradors, chihuahas and all sorts of furry characters. We are dog owners and dog lovers, and since so many people come in for a coffee while out walking the dogs, it becomes the perfect place to make friends and introduce your tail wagging companions.</p>

The beans are roasted weekly to create a unique coffee product for the Irish Market. The beans are sourced ethically to ensure the pickers are treated well and fairly. Cloudpicker Coffee focus on sustainability in all aspects of their business. The attention paid to the ethics of the business made them the perfect place to source our beans. You can taste the quality in every cup.</p>
